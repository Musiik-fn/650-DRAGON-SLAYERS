# BANA 650 PROJECT

**Group Members:** Joshua Cabal, Viridiana Radillo, Ida Karimi

## Overview
 The objective is to reproduce experiments in a published paper. We only allow group projects (max 3 students in each group). No individual student submission. You are responsible for forming groups. The successful resulting project can potentially lead to research publication at health informatics venues such as AMIA, JAMIA, and JBI.

## Chosen Research Paper
**Research Paper Name**: Predicting 30‑days mortality for MIMIC‑III patients with sepsis‑3: a machine learning
approach using XGboost
